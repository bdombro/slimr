## Demo

`npm run build && npm start`

See [packages/demo/README.md](packages/demo/README.md)

## Publishing

- `npm publish` is usually done manually and per package.

- There is a convenience script, `npm run publish:changed`, which will detect all changes and bump impacted workspaces. For example, if one changed `@slimr/css`, both that and `@slimr/styled` need be bumped because `@slimr/styled` depends on `@slimr/css`. Note that build must be ran first.
